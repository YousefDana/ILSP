Illinois Safety Program

The Illinois Safety Program Heat Maps provides the state with crash based heat maps for each county within Illinois. Two sets of maps are produced; Crash Frequency and Crash Rate. The Crash Frequency Heat Maps provides a visual representation of the number of crashes found within a square mile. The Crash Rate Heat Maps provides visual representation of the rate of crashes relative to the vehicle miles traveled within the area.

Crash Data used for this project is not pubicly available.
